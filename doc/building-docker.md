## Building seastar in Docker container

To build a Docker image:

```
docker build -t seastar-build docker/dev
```

Building is done with two commands:

```
$ ./configure.py
$ ninja -C build/release
```

You can run them inside container, e.g. like this

```
$ seabuild() { docker run -v $HOME/seastar/:/seastar -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -w /seastar -t seastar-build "$@"; }
$ seabuild ./configure.py
$ seabuild ninja -C build/release
```

Alternatively there's a `scripts/build.sh` script with the usage of

```
build.sh <mode> [<compiler>] [<compiler version>] [<c++ dialect>]
```

that will do the above steps itself, e.g. the above example would be like

```
$ scripts/build.sh release
```
